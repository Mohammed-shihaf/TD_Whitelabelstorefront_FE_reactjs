- **CC7.1 (System Monitoring & Anomaly Detection):** Automated readiness monitoring via Kubernetes readiness probes (`/`).
- **CC7.2 (Vulnerability & Patch Management):** Automated dependency auditing (`npm audit`) and containerized execution using minimal Alpine Linux base images.
- **A1.2 (Availability & System Operational Capacity):** Automated container restart policies and multi-replica deployment manifests for resilient operational capacity.
